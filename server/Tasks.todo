Tasks to Implement or Enhance

    1. Enhance Authentication and Authorization:

        Task: Implement role-based access control for different admin types (Retail Admin, Fast-Food Admin).

        Details: Modify the authMiddleware to check for specific admin roles and restrict access to certain 
        routes based on these roles.


    2. Implement Store-Type Selection:

        Task: Allow customers to select between Retail or Fast-Food store types.

        Details: Add logic to handle store-type selection on the client-side and ensure the server processes 
        requests based on the selected store type.


    3. Develop Combo Management:

        Task: Implement CRUD operations for managing fast-food combos.

        Details: Create a Combo model and corresponding routes and controllers to handle combo creation, 
        updates, and deletions.


    4. Enhance Order Management:

        Task: Implement receipt generation and order history retrieval.

        Details: Ensure the generateReceiptPDF function is correctly implemented and integrate it with order 
        processing. Add endpoints to retrieve order history for customers.


    5. Implement Reporting:

        Task: Develop endpoints for generating sales reports and low-stock alerts.

        Details: Create logic to aggregate data from orders and products to generate reports. 
        Implement endpoints to retrieve these reports based on admin roles and store types.


    6. Improve Error Handling and Validation:

        Task: Enhance error handling and input validation across all endpoints.

        Details: Use libraries like express-validator to validate incoming requests and improve error messages 
        for better debugging.

        
    7. Testing and Documentation:

        Task: Write tests for all API endpoints and document the API.

        Details: Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to write unit and integration tests. Document the API 
        using Swagger or similar tools.
